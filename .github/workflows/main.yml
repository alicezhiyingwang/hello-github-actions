#Workflows can execute based on your chosen event. For this lab, we'll be using the push event.
#Workflows are defined in special files in the .github/workflows directory, named main.yml.

name: A workflow for my Hello World file
# gives your workflow a name. This name appears on any pull request or in the Actions tab. The name is especially useful when there are multiple workflows in your repository.
on: push
#indicates that your workflow will execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the push event.

#Workflows piece together jobs, and jobs piece together steps. We'll now create a job that runs an action. 
#Add an action block to your workflow file
jobs:
  build:
    name: Hello world action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: ./action-a
        with:
          MY_NAME: "Mona"
